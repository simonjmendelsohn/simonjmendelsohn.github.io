# **Biography**

### The Short Version

Hi!  My name is Simon Mendelsohn, and I'm a software engineer at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).  I one-box [Newcomb's Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox), and my favorite books are HPMOR by Eliezer Yudkowsky and The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss.  I also like to play soccer and chess, and I believe that seven days without a pun makes one weak.

The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:simonjmendelsohn@gmail.com).

### A Bit Longer
I grew up in Livingston New Jersey, the third of seven children.  When I was in high school, my cousin taught me how to code.  The next summer I interned at [Supply Clinic](https://www.supplyclinic.com/), where I was able to put my coding to the test, while learning about the startup world.  

In 2016 I started college at Yale, where I pursued Computer Science and Data Science.  Outside the classroom, I was president of the Chess Club and helped run [math competitions for high school students](https://www.mmaths.org/).  I was also involved in a couple of research groups:

* [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/): Inside the CLAY
   lab, I analyzed the linguistic abilities of a variety of different neural networks, including a stack-based approach.  I also worked in the realm of psycholinguistics, analyzing the relationships between computational language models and human eye-tracking data.
* [Interactive Machines Group](https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io/): I spent some time working in Unity to create an interactive 3-D Model of a robot to simulate it [following an object in space](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zYM-B6oEP8).  I also spent some time simulating multi-agent environments to explore the dynamics of pro-social AI.  Finally, I made a cooperative form of the classic "Space Invaders" game where the player plays alongside an AI agent to defeat the invaders.  See video [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRTLb7BgCpY). 

After college, I joined Amazon full-time as a Software Development Engineer, where I worked to improve the experience of third-party sellers on Amazon's website.  I also helped create a machine learning orchestrator to help productionize a variety of models.

I am now at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where I work on creating a portal to securely perform [GWAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study) using [multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation).
