# **Biography**

### The Short Version

I am a senior at Yale University studying Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science.  My interests include full-stack development, Robotics, AI, and machine learning. 

The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:simonjmendelsohn@gmail.com).

### A Bit Longer
I grew up in Livingston New Jersey, the third of seven children.  When I was in high school, my [cousin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-dickstein-4b335968/) taught me how to code.  The next summer I was lucky enough to intern at [Supply Clinic](https://www.supplyclinic.com/), where I was able to put my coding to the test, while learning about the startup world.  

In 2016 I started college at Yale, where I have pursued a degree in Computer Science.  Outside the classroom, I have also been involved in a couple of research groups:

* [Computational Linguistics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/): Inside the CLAY
   lab, I analyze the linguistic abilities of a variety of different neural networks. Most recently, I've been analyzing a [stack-based approach](https://github.com/viking-sudo-rm/StackNN).
* [Interactive Machines Group](https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io/): I spent some time working in Unity to create an interactive 3-D Model of a robot to simulate it [following an object in space](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zYM-B6oEP8).  I also spent some time simulating multi-agent environments to [explore the dynamics of pro-social AI](https://github.com/social-dilemma/multiagent).
